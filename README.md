## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The web application offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to input their starting and destination points.

- **Interactive Grid:** The interactive Grid displays the available routes between the selected points, highlighting the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.

- **Shortest Distance Calculation:** path visualizer utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate and display the shortest distance between the chosen points, ensuring efficient route planning.

- **Visual Representation:** The application visually represents the recommended route, making it convenient for users to follow the path and reach the finish point.

## How It Works

1. **Input Obstacles:** Enter your obstacle point in the provided fields on the web application.

2. **Algorithm Processing:** The application processes your input using Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest route between the two points.

3. **Route Visualization:** The recommended route is then displayed on the interactive grid, showing each step of the process.

4. **Distance Calculation:** GPS Navigator calculates and presents the exact distance between the chosen locations, helping you plan your travel time accurately.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Provides the structure and layout of the web page.
- CSS: Enhances the visual appeal and styling of the application.
- JavaScript: Implements the Dijkstra's algorithm for route calculation and map interaction.
